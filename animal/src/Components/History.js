              In 2002 our founding family established Udaipur's first and only
              shelter and hospital for ownerless animals. As word spread, a few
              rescue requests a week became more than 100 calls each day. Tens
              of thousands of animals have been rescued and saved, and the
              community's compassion has blossomed into action.

              In 1994 Animal Aidâ€™s founders Erika, Jim and daughter Claire began
              travelling from their home in Seattle, USA, to India, where they
              fell in love with the country, and especially the small city of
              Udaipur, Rajasthan. Their professions as consultants gave them
              flexibility, and loving Indian culture, they planned to gradually
              live in Udaipur. In 1999 they moved to a small village, started
              learning Hindi, and that's when they began to notice the often
              poor condition of street animals.

              The First Step

            <p>
              When they realised there were no services for ownerless animals in
              Udaipur, they contacted animal organizations around the world, and
              began to learn what they could do to help. This is when their life
              work of learning how to rescue animals, hiring and training staff,
              and raising funds for medicine and food began. In 2002 they hired
              a veterinarian and began training local villagers in animal care,
              rented a small piece of land and slowly started to rescue injured
              animals.

              Within a few months, our 40 kennels and two small paddocks became
              filled with rescued dogs, donkeys and cows. With no village
              phones, reports of animal problems reached us by word of mouth.
              But with the arrival of cell phones and thanks to ads in the
              newspapers, leaflet drops in schools and community groups, rescue
              requests multiplied. More than ever before, the lives of animals
              in Udaipur were being saved.
