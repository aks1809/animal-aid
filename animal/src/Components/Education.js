              Rescuing street animals and providing a place where people can
              interact with animals teaches and inspires compassion. Recognizing
              animals who need help is something that can be learned, and when
              people are equipped with the knowledge of how to help they are
              more likely to act. We are teaching people to take action, whether
              by calling our rescue line or by taking our training course in
              First Aid; whether by making compassionate food choices or by
              volunteering.

              We educate the community about how to identify health problems so
              that minor issues don't become serious. For instance, applying
              medicated fly repellent can prevent wounds from getting infected
              with maggots. Treating wounds, mange and other conditions early is
              key to preventing suffering.

              School kids to the rescue

            <p>
              Before Animal Aid, there was no helpline for street animals in
              Udaipur and we didn't know if anyone would even call. But
              thousands of children whose classrooms we visited learned and
              spread this message: when you see an injured or ill street animal,
              call Animal Aid to help. Today we have one of the busiest
              helplines in the country. We continue to educate children about
              how to save injured and ill street animals, and we also create
              awareness about other ways to help animals such as reporting
              cruelty, humane pet guardianship and the compelling reasons to go
              vegan.

              Teaching compassion through rescue
            </h1>
            <p>
              When we are rescuing an animal, a crowd often gathers and they
              witness an animal being treated with kindness. From saving our
              helpline number in their phones, to learning that conditions like
              mange are actually treatable, everyone's awareness grows. Most
              people who see an animal being rescued today are more likely to
              spot an animal tomorrow who needs help and report the problem.
